# Matching an Email Regex Tutorial

Hello World, I am Jon Cerruti, a Full Stack Web Developement Coding Bootcamp student. I have been tasked with developing a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or "regex", functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. I hope you enjoy my tutorial and gain some new knowledge along the way. Let's dive in!

## Summary

A regular expression or regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. In this tutorial I will be breaking down Matching an Email regex. This common regex is commonly used in validating an input.

An example of this regex is shown below: 
 

/^(https?:\/\/)?([\ da-z \ .-]+) \ .([a-z \ .]{2,6})([\/\w \ .-]* )*\/?$/
